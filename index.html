We provide employees with financial tools to enable them to make better financial decisions and achieve financial freedom.

                            <li>Earnipay is offered to employees in partnership with their employers. Meaning, employees can only access Earnipay if their employer onboards them on Earnipay. The employers <a href="#">signup</a>on Earnipay and add their employees in a simple process and immediately, their employees have access to all of our financial tools.</li>
                            <li>We are a workplace benefit. This means Earnipay is a financial benefit employers offer employees. Employees in Africa are experiencing a financial health pandemic. To come out of this pandemic, employers need to play an active role in promoting our financial health and helping us pay attention to it.

An employee with a monthly net salary of N150,000 in a 30 days month would earn N5,000 per day. In five (5) days, the employee would accrue N25,000. With Earnipay, the employee can access 50% of their earned salary by the 5th day and not need to wait till the end of the month or borrow to afford daily expenses and urgent payments</li>
